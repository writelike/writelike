<a href="https://writelike.io">WriteLike</a> is a simple PHP app that rewrites text in the style of someone else. The user uploads writing sample content and an AI model is then invoked to rewrite the submitted text according to the style of the uploaded samples. It allows the user to select from any of the models that are available from kluster.ai - all that is required is an API key from there. The only other dependencies are curl and pdftotext (which can be installed with sudo apt install poppler-utils). <br/><br/>
